# Kubernetes-deploy-app

This project is a Flask web application that interfaces with a MongoDB database, offering user interaction through a form and exposing several diagnostic API endpoints.

The app features a simple front-end rendered using Jinja templates, where users can submit messages stored in a MongoDB collection; this interaction is managed through a /test_db route with form validation.

It utilizes environment variables for key configurations such as background color, MongoDB connection details, and error flagsâ€”making it highly adaptable and suitable for different deployment environments.

The entire setup is deployed on Kubernetes using a combination of a Deployment for the application and a StatefulSet for MongoDB, backed by persistent storage to retain data across pod restarts.

Robust health check endpoints (/healthz and /healthx) are implemented to ensure Kubernetes can perform proper liveness and readiness probing, while ConfigMap and Secret resources provide secure and flexible runtime configuration.
